Individual Brainstorm
‚ùì Question #1:  Describe your website subject in detail:

What do you already know about it? (50+ words)
I‚Äôve decided to tackle the issue of equity in education. As such, I recently started an organization at the school where I teach to help address the achievement gap between Black students and other racial groups. Last year‚Äôs end of school year data indicated that only 38% of Black students at my school were proficient in Math and Reading combined. Compared to 81% of White students. Hearing this is very disheartening. Although I‚Äôm a post-baccalaureate student, I am also a teacher, and I‚Äôm Black. I spearheaded the start of an organization called PAACT (Pledging to Advance Academic Capacity Together), named after the University of Florida version of the program. The goal of the organization is to provide mentorship opportunities to Black students at my school by pairing them up with Black students from the University of Florida. We‚Äôve already received  two grants totaling about 3,000 to be used on supplies and academic trips. The website I‚Äôve designed will be used as a hub of information for mentors and volunteers. The goal is to grow the organization and strengthen the partnership between my elementary school and UF. 


What do you need to find out? (20+ words)
There isn‚Äôt much that I need to find out. I‚Äôve been working in education, in particular with equity in education since I joined Teach For America back in 2007. I‚Äôm clear on the direction of the organization. I would, however, need to do some user testing and make improvements to the design of the website.


Who is impacted by this issue? (20+ words)
Black students and society as a whole feel the impact of this issue. Helping to close the achievement gap, benefits everyone.


‚ùì Question #2: Describe your proposed website in detail:

What is the purpose of your website? (30+ words)
The purpose of my website is to be a hub for disseminating information to volunteers and mentors. It‚Äôs also a place where (eventually) sponsors can choose to make material or financial donations. This is not the main goal, but is something to think about implementing in the future.


Who is your intended user? (30+ words)
Intended users include my University of Florida mentors, community volunteers, and Alachua County School personnel including my principal and the other organizers. Anyone interested in equity in education in Alachua County may end up being users as well.


How will your user interact with your website? (30+ words)
I‚Äôve already constructed the design of the website. The website includes a page specific to mentors, telling them how to become a mentor. The website also includes a page for volunteers explaining the process and asks them to complete a form. There will be photo evidence of the mentor experiences located throughout the website. There‚Äôs a ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù page and a ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù page which gives facts about the achievement gap and why we should care. There‚Äôs a section that includes the mission and vision, upcoming events, and ways to get involved.
